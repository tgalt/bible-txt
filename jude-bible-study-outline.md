# Bible Study Outline: The Book of Jude
## A Study Guide with Insights from Dr. Michael Heiser's Approach

---

## Introduction to Jude

### Background Information
- **Author**: Jude (Judas), brother of James and half-brother of Jesus (Matthew 13:55; Mark 6:3)
- **Date**: Likely AD 65-80
- **Audience**: Jewish Christians familiar with Second Temple Jewish literature
- **Purpose**: Warning against false teachers and apostates; encouragement to contend for the faith
- **Key Theme**: Judgment on false teachers using examples from Jewish tradition

### Why Jude is Challenging (and Fascinating)
- Dense with allusions to Second Temple Jewish literature (1 Enoch, Assumption of Moses)
- Assumes knowledge of Jewish interpretive traditions
- Heavy emphasis on the supernatural/cosmic dimension of apostasy
- Quote from non-canonical sources raises questions about inspiration and authority

---

## Section 1: Greeting and Occasion (Jude 1-4)

### Verses 1-2: Salutation
**Text**: "Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, To those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ: May mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you."

#### Key Points:
- Jude identifies as "servant" not "brother of Jesus" (humility)
- Identifies with James (leader of Jerusalem church)
- Triple description of believers: called, beloved, kept
- Heiser insight: "kept for" (τετηρημένοις) connects to theme of divine protection against apostasy

### Verses 3-4: The Reason for Writing
**Text**: "Beloved, although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints. For certain people have crept in unnoticed..."

#### Key Points:
- **"Contend for the faith"** (ἐπαγωνίζεσθαι) - athletic/military metaphor, suggests vigorous effort
- **"Once for all delivered"** - the faith is fixed, not evolving
- **"Crept in unnoticed"** (παρεισέδυσαν) - infiltration language, sinister connotation

#### The False Teachers Described (v. 4):
1. "Designated long ago for this condemnation" - echoes predestination themes
2. "Ungodly people" - covenant rebels
3. "Pervert the grace of God into sensuality" - antinomianism
4. "Deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ" - Christological heresy

#### Heiser Context:
- The opponents may be early Gnostics or proto-Gnostics
- Their theology likely downplayed moral consequences ("cheap grace")
- Possible connection to Nicolaitans (Revelation 2:6, 15)

---

## Section 2: Three Old Testament Examples of Judgment (Jude 5-7)

### Overview: The Pattern of Divine Judgment
Jude uses three well-known examples to establish that God judges apostasy and rebellion:
1. Wilderness generation (v. 5)
2. Rebellious angels (v. 6)
3. Sodom and Gomorrah (v. 7)

### Verse 5: The Exodus Generation
**Text**: "Now I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe."

#### Key Points:
- **Textual issue**: Some manuscripts read "Jesus" (Ἰησοῦς), others "Lord" (κύριος)
- If "Jesus," Jude identifies Jesus as YHWH who led Israel in wilderness
- The saved generation vs. the destroyed generation
- Salvation doesn't guarantee perseverance without faith

#### Heiser Insight:
- This is a Divine Identity passage if "Jesus" is the correct reading
- Jesus = YHWH of the Old Testament (pre-incarnate Christ)
- Numbers 14 background: the rebellion at Kadesh-barnea
- Point: Even experiencing God's deliverance doesn't exempt one from judgment

### Verse 6: The Rebellious Angels
**Text**: "And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day."

#### Key Points:
- **Which angels?** The Watchers of Genesis 6:1-4 and 1 Enoch 6-19
- **"Did not keep their own position"** (ἀρχήν) - abandoned their assigned role in divine council
- **"Left their proper dwelling"** (οἰκητήριον) - left their heavenly realm
- **"Eternal chains"** - imprisoned in Tartarus (see 2 Peter 2:4)
- **Awaiting final judgment** - intermediate punishment, final judgment still coming

#### The Genesis 6 Connection (Heiser's Specialty):
This is the rebellion of the "sons of God" (bene elohim) in Genesis 6:1-4:
- Divine beings took human wives
- Produced Nephilim (giants)
- This cosmic sin corrupted humanity, leading to the Flood
- Central to Second Temple Jewish theology

#### 1 Enoch Background:
Jude clearly draws from 1 Enoch (not Scripture but widely known):
- 1 Enoch 6-11: The Watchers rebel, led by Semyaza and Azazel
- 1 Enoch 10: God commands angels to bind the Watchers
- 1 Enoch 12-16: Enoch pronounces judgment on them
- The Watchers taught humanity forbidden knowledge (weapons, cosmetics, sorcery)

#### Heiser's Framework:
- This isn't mythology but reflects the ancient Israelite cosmic worldview
- The Bible presents a multi-layered rebellion:
  1. Eden (Genesis 3) - Satan corrupts humanity
  2. Watchers (Genesis 6) - Divine beings corrupt humanity
  3. Babel (Genesis 11) - Nations given to "sons of God" as punishment (Deuteronomy 32:8-9)
- Understanding this context is crucial for biblical theology
- These rebellious supernatural beings are the "principalities and powers" of Ephesians 6

#### Why Does Jude Use This Example?
- Shows that even exalted beings aren't exempt from judgment
- Sexual immorality with cosmic implications (connects to v. 7)
- Background for understanding spiritual warfare behind false teaching

### Verse 7: Sodom and Gomorrah
**Text**: "Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire."

#### Key Points:
- **"Likewise"** (τὸν ὅμοιον τρόπον) - in the same way as the angels in v. 6
- **"Sexual immorality"** (ἐκπορνεύσασαι) - intense form of πορνεία
- **"Unnatural desire"** (σαρκὸς ἑτέρας) - literally "other flesh" or "strange flesh"
- **Connection to Genesis 6?** The phrase suggests crossing boundaries like the angels did

#### Heiser Insight: "Strange Flesh"
This is a debated phrase. Two interpretations:

**Option 1: Homosexuality**
- Traditional view: refers to same-sex relations (Genesis 19)
- The men of Sodom wanted to have sex with the visiting angels
- This was both homosexual and a violation of human-angelic boundaries

**Option 2: Human-Angel Sexual Boundary Violation**
- "Strange flesh" parallels the angels going after human women (v. 6)
- Sodom's sin was pursuing angels (cf. Genesis 19 - the visitors were angels)
- This mirrors the Genesis 6 sin in reverse: humans pursuing angels
- This reading strengthens the parallel with v. 6

**Heiser's Take**: Likely both elements are present
- The men of Sodom pursued the angels for sexual purposes
- This was both same-sex sin AND crossing the human-spiritual boundary
- The phrase "strange flesh" (σαρκὸς ἑτέρας) suggests boundary violation
- Genesis 19 and Genesis 6 are bookends of the same theme: improper mixing of divine and human realms

#### The Triple Example Pattern:
1. **Believers who apostatize** (Exodus generation)
2. **Angels who rebel** (Watchers)
3. **Cities that practice extreme immorality** (Sodom)

All three show God's certain judgment on rebellion.

---

## Section 3: Description of the False Teachers (Jude 8-16)

### Verse 8: The Opponents' Characteristics
**Text**: "Yet in like manner these people also, relying on their dreams, defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme the glorious ones."

#### Three Accusations:
1. **"Defile the flesh"** - sexual immorality (like Sodom)
2. **"Reject authority"** (κυριότητα) - reject lordship/dominion, possibly Christ's authority
3. **"Blaspheme the glorious ones"** (δόξας) - slander celestial beings

#### Heiser Insight: What Does "Blaspheme the Glorious Ones" Mean?
This is puzzling. Options:

**Option 1: Slandering Good Angels**
- Less likely; why would false teachers do this?

**Option 2: Slandering Demons/Fallen Angels**
- More likely given v. 9 context
- The false teachers spoke recklessly about spiritual entities
- They didn't respect the reality and danger of the demonic realm
- Contrast with Michael's caution (v. 9)

**Option 3: Rejecting Authority of Divine Council**
- They reject God's cosmic governmental structure
- Possible connection to antinomianism: no spiritual or moral authority binds them

**Heiser's View**: 
- Likely Option 2/3 combined
- The false teachers had a faulty view of the spiritual realm
- They treated demonic powers carelessly, perhaps claiming authority over them without proper respect
- This shows their ignorance of cosmic realities

### Verse 9: Michael and the Devil
**Text**: "But when the archangel Michael, contending with the devil, was disputing about the body of Moses, he did not presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment, but said, 'The Lord rebuke you.'"

#### Background: The Assumption of Moses
- This story comes from a Jewish text called "The Assumption of Moses" (now mostly lost)
- Michael was burying Moses' body
- Satan claimed the body (possibly because Moses was a murderer - Exodus 2:11-12)
- Michael didn't revile Satan but appealed to God's authority

#### Key Points:
- **Michael's restraint**: Even an archangel doesn't pronounce judgment on Satan directly
- **"The Lord rebuke you"**: Appeals to God's authority, not his own
- **Contrast**: If Michael shows restraint, how much more should humans?

#### Heiser Insight:
- **Why does Jude quote a non-canonical source?**
  - It was well-known to his audience
  - Quoting doesn't equal canonizing
  - Paul quotes pagan poets (Acts 17:28; Titus 1:12)
  - The point of the story is theologically valid whether the event is historical or parabolic
  
- **The cosmic hierarchy**:
  - God > Archangels > Lower angels > Humans > Demons
  - Michael respects this hierarchy
  - Even though Satan is fallen, Michael shows proper protocol
  - Humans who are careless about spiritual realities are foolish

- **Application**: 
  - Don't be flippant about demonic entities
  - Don't claim authority you don't have in the spiritual realm
  - Spiritual warfare requires humility and reliance on God

### Verse 10: Ignorance and Destruction
**Text**: "But these people blaspheme all that they do not understand, and they are destroyed by all that they, like unreasoning animals, understand instinctively."

#### Key Points:
- They speak against what they don't understand (the spiritual realm)
- They live by base instincts like animals
- This will lead to their destruction

### Verse 11: Three Wicked Examples
**Text**: "Woe to them! For they walked in the way of Cain and abandoned themselves to Balaam's error for the sake of gain and perished in Korah's rebellion."

#### The Triple Woe:
1. **The Way of Cain** (Genesis 4)
   - Cain rejected God's way of worship/sacrifice
   - He murdered his brother
   - First human rebel after the Fall
   - Jewish tradition: Cain was of the evil one (1 John 3:12)
   
2. **Balaam's Error** (Numbers 22-25, 31:16)
   - Balaam couldn't curse Israel for money
   - But he taught Balak to cause Israel to sin (sexual immorality + idolatry)
   - Type of greedy false teacher
   - Led God's people astray for profit
   
3. **Korah's Rebellion** (Numbers 16)
   - Korah challenged Moses' authority
   - Led a rebellion against God's appointed leaders
   - God judged them dramatically (earth swallowed them)
   - Type of those who reject authority

#### Pattern Recognition:
- Cain = rejection of God's way, hatred of the righteous
- Balaam = greed, leading people into sin
- Korah = rebellion against God-ordained authority

All three are negative examples from Torah.

### Verses 12-13: Six Metaphors of Empty Futility
**Text**: "These are hidden reefs at your love feasts, as they feast with you without fear, shepherds feeding themselves; waterless clouds, swept along by winds; fruitless trees in late autumn, twice dead, uprooted; wild waves of the sea, casting up the foam of their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever."

#### The Six Metaphors:
1. **Hidden reefs** - dangerous, cause shipwreck at fellowship meals
2. **Shepherds feeding themselves** - self-serving, not caring for flock (Ezekiel 34)
3. **Waterless clouds** - promise rain but deliver nothing
4. **Fruitless trees** - twice dead, uprooted (judgment imagery)
5. **Wild waves** - turbulent, shameful foam (Isaiah 57:20)
6. **Wandering stars** - not fixed, unreliable (leads astray)

#### Heiser Insight: "Wandering Stars"
- In ancient cosmology, planets were "wandering stars" (vs. fixed stars)
- May also reference fallen angels/spirits
- 1 Enoch 18:13-16, 21:1-6 describes fallen stars (angels) reserved for judgment
- The "gloom of utter darkness" = Tartarus, where rebellious angels are kept
- This connects the false teachers to the fate of rebellious spiritual beings

### Verses 14-15: Prophecy from 1 Enoch
**Text**: "It was also about these that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, 'Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his holy ones, to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.'"

#### The Direct Quote from 1 Enoch
- This is a direct quote from 1 Enoch 1:9
- Jude calls Enoch a prophet and his words a prophecy
- **Major theological question**: How can Scripture quote non-canonical sources?

#### Heiser's Answer to the Canon Question:
1. **Quoting ≠ Canonizing**
   - Jude found this quote useful and true
   - Doesn't mean all of 1 Enoch is inspired
   - Paul quotes pagan poets without endorsing paganism
   
2. **1 Enoch Was Widely Known**
   - Dead Sea Scrolls contained multiple copies of 1 Enoch
   - Second Temple Jews held it in high regard
   - Jude's audience would recognize the quote
   
3. **The Quote Is Theologically Sound**
   - God will return with his holy ones (angels) for judgment
   - Parallels Matthew 25:31, 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10, Revelation 19:14
   - The content aligns with biblical revelation
   
4. **Enoch as a Historical Figure**
   - Genesis 5:18-24: Enoch walked with God and was taken
   - He was a prophet (Genesis 5:24, Hebrews 11:5)
   - Whether he wrote 1 Enoch is separate from whether the quote is true

5. **Authority Lies in Jude, Not 1 Enoch**
   - Under inspiration, Jude selected this quote
   - Its authority comes from being in Scripture, not from 1 Enoch
   - Similar to how Paul's quotes from pagans are authoritative in Acts/Epistles

#### The Prophecy's Content:
- **"The Lord comes"** - Second Coming
- **"With ten thousands of his holy ones"** - angelic army (Deuteronomy 33:2, Zechariah 14:5)
- **Purpose**: Execute judgment on the ungodly
- **Four-fold "ungodly"** - emphasis on covenant rebellion
- **Judgment on deeds AND words** - comprehensive accountability

#### Application:
- The false teachers will face this judgment
- Their ungodly deeds and harsh words against Christ are noted
- Certainty of future judgment should motivate holy living

### Verse 16: Final Description of False Teachers
**Text**: "These are grumblers, malcontents, following their own sinful desires; they are loud-mouthed boasters, showing favoritism to gain advantage."

#### Five Characteristics:
1. **Grumblers** - like wilderness generation (v. 5)
2. **Malcontents** - never satisfied, always complaining
3. **Follow sinful desires** - lustful, self-indulgent
4. **Loud-mouthed boasters** - arrogant speech
5. **Show favoritism for gain** - manipulative, greedy

---

## Section 4: Exhortation to Believers (Jude 17-23)

### Verses 17-19: Remember the Apostles' Warning
**Text**: "But you must remember, beloved, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. They said to you, 'In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions.' It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit."

#### Key Points:
- Apostles predicted false teachers in the "last time"
- "Last time" = the entire church age (1 John 2:18)
- These scoffers are:
  - Following ungodly passions
  - Causing divisions
  - Worldly (ψυχικοί) - literally "soulish," natural, unspiritual
  - **"Devoid of the Spirit"** - not genuinely regenerate

#### Heiser Insight: Worldly vs. Spiritual
- Paul uses ψυχικός (soulish/natural) vs. πνευματικός (spiritual) in 1 Corinthians 2:14-15
- The natural person doesn't accept things of the Spirit
- False teachers, despite claims, lack the Spirit
- This is discernment tool: look for fruit of the Spirit

### Verses 20-21: Four Commands for Believers
**Text**: "But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life."

#### The Four Imperatives:
1. **Build yourselves up in the faith**
   - Grow in knowledge and understanding
   - Faith = the body of apostolic teaching
   
2. **Pray in the Holy Spirit**
   - Spirit-empowered prayer
   - Contrast to the false teachers who lack the Spirit
   
3. **Keep yourselves in God's love**
   - Remain in the sphere of God's covenant love
   - Active obedience maintaining relationship
   
4. **Wait for Christ's mercy**
   - Eager expectation of Second Coming
   - Ultimate salvation = glorification

#### Heiser Note: Trinitarian Formula
- Faith (God the Father's revelation)
- Holy Spirit (empowering prayer)
- Lord Jesus Christ (object of hope)
- Implicit Trinitarianism in practical instruction

### Verses 22-23: Ministry to Three Groups
**Text**: "And have mercy on those who doubt; save others by snatching them out of the fire; to others show mercy with fear, hating even the garment stained by the flesh."

#### Three Groups (textual variants make this disputed):

**Group 1: Those Who Doubt** (τοὺς διακρινομένους)
- Have mercy on doubters
- They're wavering, struggling with false teaching
- Approach: Gentleness, patience, instruction

**Group 2: Those in Danger** 
- "Snatch them from the fire"
- Urgency required
- They're on the brink of judgment
- Approach: Aggressive rescue

**Group 3: Those Deeply Contaminated**
- Show mercy but "with fear"
- Hate even the garment stained by flesh
- Reference to Zechariah 3:3-5 (Joshua's filthy garments)
- They're so deep in sin that rescuers must be cautious
- Approach: Mercy but with self-protection, avoiding contamination

#### Heiser Application:
- Different people need different approaches
- Some need gentle persuasion, others urgent intervention
- Be wise about spiritual danger - sin is contagious
- Balance mercy with self-preservation from defilement
- This is practical spiritual warfare

---

## Section 5: Doxology (Jude 24-25)

### Verses 24-25: Closing Praise
**Text**: "Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy, to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen."

#### God's Power to Preserve:
- **"Able to keep you from stumbling"** (φυλάξαι ἀπταίστους)
  - God guards believers
  - Connects to v. 1 "kept for Jesus Christ"
  - Assurance despite danger of false teachers
  
- **"Present you blameless"**
  - Eschatological presentation (Ephesians 5:27, Colossians 1:22)
  - Before God's glorious presence
  - With great joy (not fear)

#### The Fourfold Ascription:
1. **Glory** (δόξα) - splendor, radiance
2. **Majesty** (μεγαλωσύνη) - greatness
3. **Dominion** (κράτος) - power, might
4. **Authority** (ἐξουσία) - right to rule

#### Time Frame:
- Before all time (eternal past)
- Now (present)
- Forever (eternal future)

#### Heiser's Pastoral Insight:
- Jude begins with threats and warnings
- He ends with absolute confidence in God's power
- The same God who judges rebels preserves his people
- Our security rests not in our strength but God's faithfulness
- This doxology is the ultimate answer to apostasy threats

---

## Major Themes in Jude (Heiser Perspective)

### 1. The Cosmic Conflict
- Jude presents apostasy as part of larger spiritual warfare
- False teaching isn't just bad ideas - it's demonic deception
- The spiritual realm (angels, demons, Satan) is real and active
- Understanding Genesis 6 and Divine Council theology is crucial

### 2. Judgment on Rebellion
- God consistently judges those who rebel (wilderness, angels, Sodom)
- No one is exempt: not angels, not Israelites, not church members
- Judgment is certain, serious, and eternal

### 3. The Use of Second Temple Literature
- Jude quotes 1 Enoch and alludes to Assumption of Moses
- These weren't Scripture but were part of Jewish theological context
- Shows importance of understanding biblical authors' world
- Heiser's emphasis: We need to read the Bible through ancient eyes

### 4. The Reality of Apostasy
- False teachers can infiltrate the church
- They may participate in church activities (love feasts)
- They twist grace into license
- Believers must actively contend for the faith

### 5. Assurance and Preservation
- Despite threats, God keeps his people
- The same power that judges rebels protects believers
- Final presentation will be joyful and blameless

---

## Discussion Questions (Heiser-Style)

### On Genesis 6 and the Watchers:
1. How does understanding the Genesis 6 rebellion (the Watchers) change your view of spiritual warfare?
2. Why is the supernatural dimension of biblical theology often ignored in modern churches?
3. How do the "principalities and powers" of the New Testament relate to the rebellious "sons of God" in the Old Testament?

### On Second Temple Literature:
4. Why do you think God inspired Jude to quote from 1 Enoch? What does this teach us about inspiration?
5. How can we benefit from reading Second Temple Jewish literature without treating it as Scripture?
6. What other New Testament passages assume knowledge that came from Jewish tradition rather than the Old Testament?

### On False Teaching:
7. How do we balance Jude's warnings against false teachers with Jesus' command not to judge?
8. What are modern equivalents to "perverting grace into license"?
9. How can we "contend for the faith" without being contentious?

### On Apostasy and Assurance:
10. How do we reconcile Jude's warnings about apostasy with assurance of salvation?
11. What's the difference between doubting believers (v. 22) and false teachers (v. 4)?
12. How should verses 24-25 affect our view of perseverance?

### On Application:
13. How should we approach spiritual warfare in light of Michael's caution with Satan (v. 9)?
14. What does it mean practically to "keep yourself in the love of God" (v. 21)?
15. How do we discern which approach to use with people influenced by false teaching (v. 22-23)?

## Conclusion

The book of Jude, though brief, is theologically rich and assumes significant knowledge of Second Temple Jewish thought. Dr. Michael Heiser's approach helps us read Jude in its original context, taking seriously:

1. The supernatural worldview of the biblical authors
2. The importance of Genesis 6 and the Divine Council
3. The value of Second Temple literature for understanding the New Testament
4. The cosmic dimensions of spiritual warfare and apostasy

By understanding these contexts, we gain:
- Deeper appreciation for Jude's warnings
- Better discernment of false teaching
- Stronger confidence in God's power to preserve us
- More complete biblical theology of the spiritual realm

May this study equip you to "contend for the faith" with wisdom, knowledge, and reliance on the God "who is able to keep you from stumbling."

**Amen.**
