how does your life look different as a Christian

the question is not to compare our kifes to unbeleviers but to ourselves before we were saved
there are murderers but you probably were not one. why would you then say you are good because you do not murder. 


take the log out of your own eye

 fear and trembling about our salvation 
Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.”
— Philippians 2:12–13, ESV

Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it.”
— Hebrews 4:1, ESV
